INTRODUCTION AND USAGE                    *sunset* *sunset-introduction-usage*

Sunset automatically sets 'background' when the sun rises and sets, and also
when you start Vim. When the sun is up, or rises, it’ll
‘set background=light’. When the sun is down, or sets,
it’ll ‘set background=dark’.

Sunset can also change your |colorscheme|, your Powerline theme, or do
anything else you can think of. See |'Sunset_daytime_callback()'| and
|'Sunset_nighttime_callback()'| for details.

So as not to interrupt you, Sunset waits for four seconds after you’ve pressed
a key or left insert mode (ie. on the |CursorHold| event) before changing the
background. If you change your background during the day or night, it’ll
respect that.

You must set some options in your `.vimrc` for Sunset to work, so
please read on to |sunset-configuration| for details.

INSTALLATION                                           *sunset-installation*

With a Plugin Manager:                  *sunset-installation-plugin-manager*

Vundle: ~

If you don’t already have a preferred manager, I recommend installing Vundle
(https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Once done, add the declaration for Sunset
to your `.vimrc`:
>
    Bundle 'amdt/sunset'
<
And install:
>
    :BundleInstall
<
Pathogen: ~

If you’re using Pathogen, simply extract the archive to `$HOME/.vim/bundle` or
better yet, clone the Git repository. In a UNIX shell, for example:
>
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/amdt/sunset.git
<
Using Vimball:                                 *sunset-installation-vimball*

Open the Vimball with Vim. For example, from a UNIX shell you might run:
>
    vim sunset.vba
<
Once loaded in Vim, run the following two commands:
>
    :so %
    :q
<
Manually:                                       *sunset-installation-manual*

Copy the files in the included zip archive into your 'runtimepath' as per the
following figure. The directory tree for Sunset is on the left, and the
resulting tree in your own home directory on the right:

    /doc                         :    `$HOME/.vim/doc`
        sunset.txt               :        sunset.txt
    /plugin                      :    `$HOME/.vim/plugin`
        sunset.vim               :        sunset.vim
    CONTRIBUTING.markdown        :
    README.markdown              :

Place `sunset.txt` under `$HOME/.vim/doc` and `sunset.vim` under
`$HOME/.vim/plugin` where `$HOME` is the location of your `.vim` directory.
You can find this by typing ‘|:echo| |$HOME|’. You can safely discard of
`README.markdown` and `CONTRIBUTING.markdown`.

REQUIREMENTS                                           *sunset-requirements*

    * Vim 7.3.
    * Vim compiled with |+float| support. Use |:version| to check if this
      feature is available in your build.
    * A system with |strftime()|, with the following format options:
        - %j returns the current day of the year.
        - %H returns the current hour of the day in 24-hour time.
        - %M returns the current minute of the hour.

Note: If your system’s |strftime()| differs, please open an issue on the
GitHub page at https://github.com/amdt/sunset/issues with details.

Recommended: ~

    * A |colorscheme| with both light and dark variants, such as Solarized
      (https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) or Hemisu
      (https://github.com/noahfrederick/Hemisu).

CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)                     *sunset-configuration-required*
                                                      *sunset_configuration*

'g:sunset_latitude' & 'g:sunset_longitude'               *'sunset_latitude'*
                                                        *'sunset_longitude'*

Note: If you push your dotfiles to (for example) GitHub, please
see |sunset-privacy|.

The latitude and longitude of your location in decimal. Values North and East
must be positive values, those South and West must be negative.

London, for example, lies at 51 degrees, 30 minutes North; and 7 minutes West.

In decimal, this is 51.5 degrees North, 0.1167 degrees West.

If you lived in London, you might set these options as follows:
>
    let g:sunset_latitude = 51.5
    let g:sunset_longitude = -0.1167
<
If you lived in Tokyo (35 degrees, 40 minutes and 12 seconds North; 139
degrees, 46 minutes and 12 seconds East), you might set these options
as follows:
>
    let g:sunset_latitude = 35.67
    let g:sunset_longitude = 139.8
<
Note: Don’t forget, negative values South and West.

CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL)                     *sunset-configuration-optional*

'g:sunset_utc_offset'                                  *'sunset_utc_offset'*

Sunset gets the local timezone from your system.  You can override this by
setting the difference in hours between your timezone and Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC).

For example:
>
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 0 " London
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 1 " London (British Summer Time)
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 9 " Tokyo
<
Note: Sunset does not handle any daylight savings civil times.

'g:loaded_sunset'                                          *'loaded_sunset'*

Set to a non-0 value to disable Sunset, for example:
>
    let g:loaded_sunset = 1
<

'Sunset_daytime_callback()' &                  *'Sunset_daytime_callback()'*
'Sunset_nighttime_callback()'                *'Sunset_nighttime_callback()'*

These two callbacks can be used to override Sunset’s behaviour by adding your
own. If you define either of these callbacks, Sunset’s default behaviour of
setting 'background' will be ignored, and your function will be called
instead.

For example, perhaps you want to use one |colorscheme| during the day, and
another at night:
>
    function! Sunset_daytime_callback()
        colorscheme Hemisu
    endfunction

    function! Sunset_nighttime_callback()
        colorscheme Solarized
    endfunction
<

You could change the theme used by Powerline*:
>
    function! Sunset_daytime_callback()
        if exists(':PowerlineReloadColorscheme')
            let g:Powerline_colorscheme = 'solarizedLight'
            PowerlineReloadColorscheme
        endif
    endfunction

    function! Sunset_nighttime_callback()
        if exists(':PowerlineReloadColorscheme')
            let g:Powerline_colorscheme = 'solarizedDark'
            PowerlineReloadColorscheme
        endif
    endfunction
>

A REMINDER ON PRIVACY                                       *sunset-privacy*

For those of us who publish our dotfiles on (for example) GitHub, please take
this as a gentle reminder that out of habit you might be about to publish your
whereabouts to the greater public. If this concerns you, using the location of
your nearest large city might suffice; Sunset will be plenty accurate enough.
